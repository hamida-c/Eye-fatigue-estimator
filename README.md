A lightweight desktop tool that uses your webcam and OpenCV's Haarcascade eye detector to monitor eye fatigue in real-time. It tracks how long your eyes stay closed and alerts you when signs of tiredness appear ‚Äî because your eyes need breaks too.

### Project Overview:
This project helps identify signs of eye fatigue based on prolonged eye closure. It's built with simple but effective computer vision techniques ‚Äî no deep learning, just OpenCV doing its job.
Whether you're working long hours or binge-watching something, this tool helps remind you when it's time to pause and blink.

### Features:
* Detects eyes using Haar Cascade 
* Tracks eye closure duration across frames
* Monitors fatigue events over a 60-second session
* Displays fatigue warnings when thresholds are crossed
* Shows final fatigue status at session end
* Works completely offline

### Technologies Used:

* Python
* OpenCV ‚Äì for webcam access and eye detection
* NumPy ‚Äì array operations
* Tkinter ‚Äì To display final alert messages

### How Fatigue is Measured
* Eyes are tracked using a Haar cascade classifier.
* If no eyes are detected for more than 5 consecutive frames, it's considered a fatigue incident.
* Over 60 seconds, if 8 or more incidents are detected, the app warns the user to take a break.

### Installation

Make sure Python is installed 

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/hamida-c/Eye-fatigue-estimator.git
   cd eye-fatigue-estimator

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the App:
python main.py

Press q to quit the monitoring session early.
